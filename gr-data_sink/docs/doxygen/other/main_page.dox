Welcome to the GNU Radio USB_SINK Block.

This is the intro page for the Doxygen manual generated for the USB_SINK block.

In GNU Radio a SINK-Block serves as an interface. This is necessary in order to interact with different processes or peripherials, like USB.
Therefore the USB_SINK-Block streams the input data (string) directly to a USB port.
